# thisisaforum-server

### Description
This is the backend API server for *thisisaforum*. All the backend logic is handled here. The end goal for this project is to create a forum website where users can chat with each other via threads within subforums. Subforums categorize the chats. Users can also reply to threads.

### Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS
- SCSS
- Webpack
- Grunt
- jQuery
- Heroku
- NodeJS
- Express
- Mongoose
- Passport
- Git
- Github Pages

### Planning & Story
The plan for this project was to create a fully functional forum website with all the basic features of a forum. As I started learning new technologies such as react, I noticed that rather than trying to build a client in node, I should try and create this project using react.

I was going to complete this project with threads fully working as well as replies to those threads. I will most likely finish it, but I rather focus my efforts on a react client which is significantly better than this client based off of jQuery.

### Unsolved Problems & Future Features
I plan on creating threads within subforums, and replies within threads. I also plan on polishing designs and adding icons to the website. The primary focus would be just creating a barebones forum website.

For now, all users can do is create, update, and destroy subforums.

I don't have problems with the application right now as it's extremely barebones and not what I want it to be yet.
